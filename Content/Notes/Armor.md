## (!!!PH!!!)Item tiers
(!!!PH!!!)Tiers explain how good items in each category are in comparison to each other where Tier 1 is the best. So for example if there are 5 base Two Handed Axes, Tier 5 one will be the weakest/available the earliest and Tier 1 would be the best but the hardest to access/use.

## Armor base stats
### Armour
- Integer value indicating Armour amount. Each point of armour reduces physcial damage by that amount, but to no less than 1.
  - For example: 1 Armour will reduce 10 physical damage hit to 9 (10 - 1 = 9), 11 Armour will reduce 10 physical damage hit to 1 (10 - 11 = -1, however physical damage cannot be reduced to less than 1 by Armour).

## Armor requirements
### Level
- (!!!PH!!!)An experience level cap to prevent low level classes from using high stat items (!!!PH!!!Maybe not needed with Attribute distribution?)

### Strength
- (!!!PH!!!)Integer value indicating Strength Attribute required for picking up and using bigger weapons, mostly focused on melee.

### Dexterity
- (!!!PH!!!)Integer value indicating Dexterity Attribute required for more swift weapons that would require precision to use.

### Intelligence
- (!!!PH!!!)Integer value indicating Intelligence Attribute required mostly for weapons related to magic use.

### Faith
- (!!!PH!!!)Integer value indicating Faith Attribute required mostly for weapons related to healing/buffing.

### Endurance
